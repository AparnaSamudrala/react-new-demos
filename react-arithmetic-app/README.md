created a basic arithmetic calculator app which accepts two input parameters via textboxes and one select operand that will output the arithmetic operation result and saves it in a table with the history.

You can find the replica of this app as in "https://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo/"

Used two different approaches :
1) One approach is by using traditional switch case operator (used in App.js)
2) The other way is using mathjs evaluate logic in FormLayout component
